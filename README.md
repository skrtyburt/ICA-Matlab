# ICA-Matlab
Independent component analysis as a neuroinformatics tool has the ability of recognizing maximally independent networks within a dataset. 

In the context of recognizing community structure, ICA can serve as a validation tool for multi-resolution concensus clustering (MRCC). Because the number of  components is specified prior to running the ICA, MRCC should be run and the number of detected communities should be implemented into the component parameter.
